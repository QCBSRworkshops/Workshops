What proportion of zeros?


```r
sum(spe == 0)/(nrow(spe)*ncol(spe))
```

---
# Total Species Richness 

Visualize how many species are present at each site: 


```r
site.pre &lt;- rowSums(spe &gt; 0)
barplot(site.pre,
        main = "Species richness",
        las = 1, 
        xlab = "Sites",

# Before transforming your community data... 

.alert[Important considerations:]

# Transforming your community data

## Examples 

Transforming counts into presence - absence 

```r
spec.pa &lt;- decostand(spe,method = "pa")
```

Reducing the weight of rare species


```r
spec.hel &lt;- decostand(spe,method = "hellinger")
spec.chi &lt;- decostand(spe,method = "chi.square")
```

Reducing the weight of very abundant species 


```r
spe.pa &lt;- decostand(spe,method = "log")
```



---
# Doubs Environmental Data 


```r
names(env) # Names of objects 
dim(env) # dimensions 
str(env) # structure of objects
head(env) # first 5 rows 
summary(env) # summary statistics
```

Explore colinearity by visualizing correlations between variables 


```r
pairs(env, main = "Bivariate Plots of the Environmental Data")
```


---
# Doubs Environmental Data 

![](images/EnvDat1.png)

---
# decostand() 


```r
?decostand
```
Standardizing environmental variables is crucial as you cannot compare the effects of variables with different units


```r
env.z &lt;- decostand(env, method = "standardize")
```

This centers and scales the variables to make your downstream analysis more appropriate 


```r
apply(env.z, 2, mean)
apply(env.z, 2, sd)
```

# And what about ordination? 


With ordination methods, we order our objects (site) according to their similarity 


- The more the sites are similar, the closer they are in the ordination space (smaller distances) 


- In Ecology, we usually calculate the similarity between sites according to their species composition or their environmental conditions.

# Overview of 3 hierarchical methods


- Single linkage agglomerative clustering

# Comparison 

Create a distance matrix from Hellinger transformed Doubs river data 


```r
spe.dhe1 &lt;- vegdist(spec.hel, method = "euclidean") 
```

Compute the single linkage clustering 


```r
spe.dhe1.single &lt;- hclust(spe.dhe1, method = "single")
plot(spe.dhe1.single)
```

Compute the complete linkage clustering  
   

```r
spe.dhe1.complete = hclust(spe.dhe1, method = "complete")
plot(spe.dhe1.complete)
```

---
# Comparison 

![](images/comparison.png)


.pull-left[ 

**Single linkage:** 

Chains of objects occur (e.g. 19,29,30,26)
]

.pull-right[ 

**Complete linkage:** 
Contrasted groups are formed of objects occur
]

---
# Ward's minimum variance method 

- Uses the criterion of least squares to cluster objects into groups 
  - At each step, the pair of clusters merging is the one leading to the minimum increase in total within-group sum of squares 

---
# Ward's method  

- Compute the Ward's minimum variance clustering: 

```r
spe.dhel.ward &lt;- hclust(spe.dhe1, method = "ward.D2") 
```

- Plot the dendrogram by using the square root of the distances 


```r
spe.dhel.ward$height &lt;- sqrt(spe.dhel.ward$height)
plot(spe.dhel.ward, hang = 1)
# hang = 1 aligns objects at the same level (distance = 0)
```

---
# Ward's method

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/Ward1.png)]

Clusters generated using this method tend to be more spherical and to contain similar number of objects

---
# How to choose the right method? 

- Depends on the objective 
  - highlights gradients? contrasts? 
- If more than on method seems appropriate, compare dendrograms 
- Again: this is **not** an statistical method 
 But! is possible to: 
  - determine the optimal number of interpretable clusters 
  - compute clustering statistics 
  - combine clustering to ordination to distinguish groups of sites

# 4. Unconstrained ordination 


---
# Definitions

--

- **Variance:** measure of a variable **y** *j* dispersion from its mean
--

- **Co-variance:** measure of co-dispersion of variables **y** *j* et **y** *j* from their means

--
- **Correlation:** measure of the link strength between 2 variables: rij = (dij / dj . dk)

--
- **Eigenvalues:** Proportio of variance (dispersion) represented by one ordination axe.

--
- **Orthogonality:** right angle between 2 axis or 2 arrows which means that these 2 are independent = non correlated.

--
- **Score:** position of a dot on an axis. All the scores of a dot give its coordinates in the multidimensional space. They can be used as new variable for other analyses (e.g. linear combination of measured variables).

--
- **Dispersion** (inertia): Measure of the total variability of the scatter plot (descriptors) in the multidimensional space with regards to its center of gravity. 

---
# Unconstrained ordination 

- Asses relationships **within** a set of variables (species or environmental variables, not **between** sets, i.e. constrained analysis)

- Find key components of variation between samples, sites, species, etc... ç

- Reduce the number of dimensions in multivariate data without substantial loss of information 

- Create new variables for use in subsequent analysis (such as regression)


---
# 4.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/Ord1.png)]

- Preserves, in 2D, the maximum amount of variation in the data 
- The resulting, synthetic variables are orthogonal (and therefore uncorrelated)

---
# PCA - What you need 

- A set of variables that are response variables (e.g. community composition) OR explanatory variables (e.g. environmental variables) 

**NOT BOTH!** 

.pull-left[
- Samples that are measured for the same set of variables 
- Generally a dataset that is longer than it is wide is preferred

# PCA - Multidimensional case

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

- **PC1** --&gt; axis that maximizes the variance of the points that are projected perpendicularly onto the axis. 
- **PC2** --&gt; must be perpendicular to PC1, but the direction is again the one in which variance is maximized when points are perpendicularly projected 
- **PC3** --&gt; and so on: perpendicular to the first two axes

&lt;br/&gt;

.alert[When there are more than two dimensions, PCA produces a new spaces in which all PCA axes are orthogonal (i.e. non-correlated)  and where the PCA axes are ordered according to the percent of variance of the original data they explain]

# PCA - Let's try it on Fish Species! 

- For both PCA and RDA, we will be using the rda() function in the vegan package 

```r

```

- Run a PCA on the Hellinger-transformed fish data 


```r
spe.h.pca &lt;- rda(spec.hel) 
```

- Extract the results 


```r
summary(spe.h.pca) 
```

---
# Function rda()

- RDA is in 2 steps 

  - multiple regressions
  - PCA on regressed values 
  
- If we give only one table to the function rda() it does directly a PCA without doing regression

More on this later! 

---
# PCA - Interpretation of Output 

![](images/PCAout4.png)

- Species refers to your descriptors (i.e. the columns in your dataset), which here are the Fish species
- Scores refer to the position of every species in the PC. Essentially they are the coordinates of each species along the principal component 

---
# PCA - Interpretation of Output 

![](images/PCAout5.png)

- Site refers to the rows in your dataset, which here are the different sites along the Doubs river (but it can be points in time, etc) 


---
# Accessing Parts of the Output 

The output is very dense, but you can access specific information if needed 

- Access the eigenvalues associated contribution to variance 


```r
summary(spe.h.pca, display = NULL) 
```

- Calculate the eigenvalues from scratch 

```r
eigen(cov(spec.hel))
```

---
# Accessing Parts of the Output 

You may wish to extract the scores (either from species or sites) for use in subsequent analysis or for plotting

- Access the species scores along the 1st and 2nd PC: 

```r
spe.scores &lt;-  scores(spe.h.pca, 
                      display = "species", 
                      choices = c(1,2)) 
```

- Access the site scores along the 1st and 2nd PC: 


```r
site.scores &lt;- scores(spe.h.pca, 
                      display = "sites", 
                      choices = c(1,2))
```

---
# Selecting Significant PCs

The strength of PCA is that we can condense the variance contained in a huge dataset into a set of synthetic variables that is manageable 

In our case, there are still 27 Principal Components, but only the first few account for any significant amount of variance, while the rest can simply be discarded as noise... 


--

How do we manage this?

---
# Kaiser - Guttman criterion 

Selects principal components which capture more variance than the average of all PCs

- Extract the eigenvalues associated to the PCs 

```r
ev &lt;- spe.h.pca$CA$eig
```

- Select all eigenvalues above average


```r
ev[ev&gt;mean(ev)]
```

# PCA - environmental variables 

We can also run PCAs on standardized environmental variables, to compare sites for example, or how variables are correlated... 

- Run a PCA on the standardized environmental variables 

```r
env.pca &lt;- rda(env.z)
```

- Extract the results 


```r
summary(env.pca)
summary(env.pca, scaling  = 2) # default

# Advanced "biplotting" 

- By extracting specific parts of the PCA output, we can build more detailed and aesthetic plots: 


```r

     xlab = c("PC1 (%)", round(spe.h.pca$CA$eig[1]/sum(spe.h.pca$CAeig)*100,2)),
     ylab = c("PC2 (%)", round(spe.h.pca$CA$eig[2]/sum(spe.h.pca$CA$eig)*100,2)))
points(scores(spe.h.pca, display = "sites", choices = c(1,2), scaling = 1),
       pch=21, col = "black", bg = "steelblue" , cex  = 1.2)
text(scores(spe.h.pca, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling = 1),
     scores(spe.h.pca, display = "species", choices = c(2), scaling = 1),
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.h.pca, display = "species", scaling = 1)),
     col = "red", cex = 0.8)
spe.cs &lt;- scores(spe.h.pca, choices = 1:2, scaling = 1 , display = "sp")
arrows(0,0,spe.cs[,1], spe.cs[,2], length = 0)

# Warnings 

- PCA is a linear method and thus relies on a few assumptions 

--

  - multinormal distribution of the data (only if you wish to make inferences)
  
--

  - not too many zeros 

--

  - the gradient of interest is causing the majority of the variance in the dataset 
  
.alert[
.small[ 
Violation of these can cause a horseshoe shape in your biplots, where opposite ends of the horseshoe are close together but in reality represent opposite ends of a gradient] 
]

---
# Warnings 

- We can avoid some of these problems in PCA by choosing appropriate transformations for your community composition data or environmental data 

- In some cases, such as studies that cover very large environmental gradients, it may be appropriate to use other types of unconstrained ordinations

## Euclidean vs Chi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; distances 

- PCA preserves **euclidean distances** between objects, and thus postulates **linear relationships** between species, and between species and environmental gradients. 

- ... but in **some cases, species instead present unimodal responses** to environmental gradients 

---
# Principles of CA 

- In such cases, CA should be preferred compared to PCA as it preserves **Chi2 distances between sites**... and thus better represents uni modal relationships

---
# How to run a CA? 

- CA is implemented in the vegan package using the function cca: 


```r
spe.ca &lt;- cca(spe[-8,])
# only take columns which rowsums are &gt; than 0. 

```


- CA on fish species abundances 

---
# CA: R output 

- CA results are presented in the same way as PCA results and can be called using: 


```r
summary(spe.ca)
```

# Challenge #4 ![:cube]()

Using everything you have learned to execute a CA on the mite species abundance data: 


```r
mite.spe &lt;- mite
```

- What are the significant axes? 
- Which groups of sites can you identify? 
- Which groups of species are related to these groups of sites? 

---
# Solution #4 

- Compute CA: 


```r
mite.spe.ca &lt;- cca(mite.spe)
```

- Check significant axes using the Guttman-Kaiser criterion 


```r

# 4.3. Principal Coordinates Analysis 

.center[![:scale 90%](images/Ord1.png)]

- In PCA, we preserve the maximum amount of variation in the data

- In PCoA, we preserve as best we can in 2D (Euclidean) distances between each object in multidimensional space

.alert[ PCoA can be especially useful when the dataset is wider than it is long (Typical problem in Genetics)]

---
# PCoA - Let's try it on Fish species! 

- For computing PCoA, we can use the `cmdscale()` or the `pcoa()`functions from the **stats** and **ape** packages: 


```r
?cmdscale
?pcoa
```

- Run a PCoA on the Hellinger-distances of the fish dataset 

```r
spe.h.pcoa &lt;- pcoa(dist(spec.hel))
```

- Extract the results


```r
spe.h.pcoa
```

# PCoA - Interpretation of Output 

.center[![](images/PCoAInt.png)]

- Eigenvalues

# PCoA - Interpretation of Output 

![](images/PCoA2.png)

- Vectors: the eigenvectors associated to each eigenvalue contain the coordinates, in Euclidean space, of each site. 

.alert[ These are the most useful for subsequent analysis as they capture the distance among objects very well] 


---
# PCoA biplot with biplot.pcoa() 

We can display, in 2D, the distances between sites using the `biplot.pcoa()` function, as well as the species associated to each site (though this is less common)


```r
biplot.pcoa(spe.h.pcoa, spec.hel)
```

# PCoA biplot with biplot.pcoa()

# PCoA and non-metric distances

- PCoA can also be used to capture information contained in non-metric distances, such as the popular Bray-Curtis distance. Let's give it a try:


```r
spe.bray.pcoa &lt;- pcoa(spe.db.pa)
spe.bray.pcoa 
```

- Examine the output and notice the negative eigenvalues. This is because non-metric distances cannot be represented in Euclidean space without corrections (*see* Legendre &amp; Legendre 2012 for more details on this): 


```r
spe.bray.pcoa &lt;- pcoa(spe.db.pa, correction = "cailliez")
spe.bray.pcoa
```

---
# PCoA and non-metric distances

- Now let's visualize this using a biplot without the species (more common approach for PCoA)


```r
biplot.pcoa(spe.bray.pcoa)
```

# Challenge #5 ![:cube]()

Execute a PCoA on the Hellinger-transformed mite species abundance data 

- What are the significant axes? 
- Which groups of sites can you identify? 
- Which groups of species are related to these groups of sites
- How do the PCoA results compare with the PCA results? 

---
# Solution #5

- Hellinger transform the species data 

```r
mite.spe.hel &lt;- decostand(mite.spe, method = "hellinger")
```

- Compute PCoA 


```r
mite.spe.h.pcoa &lt;- pcoa(dist(mite.spe.hel))
```

---
# Solution #5

- Build a biplot to visualize the data: 

```r
biplot.pcoa(mite.spe.h.pcoa, mite.spe.hel)
```

# 4.4. Non-metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS)

- In PCA, CA and PCoA, objects are ordinated in a few number of dimensions (i.e. axis) generally &gt; 2

- Consequently, 2D-biplots can fail to represent all the variation of the dataset

- In some cases, the objective is however to represent the data in a specified small number of dimensions 

- Then, how do you plot the ordination space to represent all the variation in the data? 

---
# Principles of NMDS 

- NMDS 
  - is the non-metric counterpart of PCoA 
  - uses an iterative optimization algorithm to find the best representation of distances in reduced space 
  - increasingly popular 
- In NMDS, users can thus specify; 
  - the number of dimensions 
  - the distance measure 

---
# How to run a NMDS 

-  nMDS is implemented in the vegan package using function metaMDS: 


```r
spe.nmds &lt;- metaMDS(spe, distance = 'bray', k = 2)
```

- *distance* specifies the distance measure to use 
- *k* specifies the number of dimensions 

---
# NMDS: goodness-of-fit 

- NMDS applies an iterative procedure that tries to position the objects in the requested number of dimensions in such a way as to minimize a stress function (scaled from 0 to 1) which measure the goodness-of-fit of the distance adjustment in the reduced-space configuration. 

- Consequently, the lower the stress value, the better the representation of objects in the ordination-space is. 

---
# NMDS: goodness-of-fit 

- The Shepard diagram and stress values can be obtained from: 


```r
spe.nmds$stress 
stressplot(spe.nmds, main = "Shepard plot")
```

---
# NMDS on fish abundances 

- Run the NMDS 


```r
spe.nmds &lt;- metaMDS(spe, distance = 'bray', k = 2)
```

- Extract the results 


```r
spe.nmds
```

- Assess the goodness of fit 


```r
spe.nmds$stress 
stressplot(spe.nmds, main = "Shepard plot") 
```

     main = paste("NMDS/Bray - Stress =",
                  round(spe.nmds$stress, 3)),
     xlab = c("NMDS1"), ylab = "NMDS2")

points(scores(spe.nmds, display = "sites",
              choiches = c(1,2),
              pch = 21,
              col = "black", 
              g = "steelblue", 
              cex = 1.2))
text(scores(spe.nmds, display = "species", choices = c(1)), 
            scores(spe.nmds, display = "species", choices = c(2)), 
            labels = rownames(scores(spe.nmds, display = "species")),
            col = "red", cex = 0.8)

|PCA| Euclidean | Quantitative data, linear relationships | p | 
|CA| Chi2 | Non-negative, quantitative homogeneous data, binary data | p-1 |
|PCoA| User defined | Quantitative, semi-quantitative, mixed data| p-1|
