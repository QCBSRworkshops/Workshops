With ordination methods, we order our objects (site) according to their similarity


- The more the sites are similar, the closer they are in the ordination space (smaller distances)

# Ward's minimum variance method

- Uses the criterion of least squares to cluster objects into groups
  - At each step, the pair of clusters merging is the one leading to the minimum increase in total within-group sum of squares

---
# Ward's method  

Compute the Ward's minimum variance clustering and plot the dendrogram by using the square root of the distances:

```{r, fig.width=9, echo = -1}
par(mar=c(.5,3.8,2,.5), cex = 1.5)
spe.dhel.ward <- hclust(spe.dhe1, method = "ward.D2")
spe.dhel.ward$height <- sqrt(spe.dhel.ward$height)
plot(spe.dhel.ward, hang = -1) # hang = -1 aligns objects at the same level
```

---
# Ward's method

```{r, fig.width=9, echo = F}
par(mar=c(.5,3.8,2,.5), cex = 1.5)
plot(spe.dhel.ward, hang = -1) # hang = -1 aligns objects at the same level
```

Clusters generated using this method tend to be more spherical and to contain similar number of objects

---
# How to choose the right method?

- Depends on the objective
  - highlights gradients? contrasts?
- If more than on method seems appropriate, compare dendrograms
- Again: this is **not** an statistical method
 But! is possible to:
  - determine the optimal number of interpretable clusters
  - compute clustering statistics
  - combine clustering to ordination to distinguish groups of sites

# 4. Unconstrained ordination


---
# Definitions

--

- **Variance:** measure of a variable **y** *j* dispersion from its mean
--

- **Co-variance:** measure of co-dispersion of variables **y** *j* et **y** *j* from their means

--
- **Correlation:** measure of the link strength between 2 variables: rij = (dij / dj . dk)

--
- **Eigenvalues:** Proportio of variance (dispersion) represented by one ordination axe.

--
- **Orthogonality:** right angle between 2 axis or 2 arrows which means that these 2 are independent = non correlated.

--
- **Score:** position of a dot on an axis. All the scores of a dot give its coordinates in the multidimensional space. They can be used as new variable for other analyses (e.g. linear combination of measured variables).

--
- **Dispersion** (inertia): Measure of the total variability of the scatter plot (descriptors) in the multidimensional space with regards to its center of gravity.

---
# Unconstrained ordination

- Asses relationships **within** a set of variables (species or environmental variables, not **between** sets, i.e. constrained analysis)

- Find key components of variation between samples, sites, species, etc... ç

- Reduce the number of dimensions in multivariate data without substantial loss of information

- Create new variables for use in subsequent analysis (such as regression)


---
# 4.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

.center[

- Preserves, in 2D, the maximum amount of variation in the data
- The resulting, synthetic variables are orthogonal (and therefore uncorrelated)

**NOT BOTH!**

# PCA - Interpretation of Output

![](images/PCAout4.png)

The output is very dense, but you can access specific information if needed. For example, you can access the eigenvalues associated contribution to variance :

```{r}

# Accessing Parts of the Output

You can calculate the eigenvalues from scratch

```{r}
eigen(cov(spec.hel))
```



---
# Accessing Parts of the Output

You may wish to extract the scores (either from species or sites) for use in subsequent analysis or for plotting

- Access the species scores along the 1st and 2nd PC:
```{r}
spe.scores <- scores(spe.h.pca,
                     display = "species",
                     choices = c(1,2))
```

- Access the site scores along the 1st and 2nd PC:

```{r}
site.scores <- scores(spe.h.pca,
                      display = "sites",
                      choices = c(1,2))
```

---
# Selecting Significant PCs

<br>

- The strength of PCA is that we can condense the variance contained in a huge dataset into a set of synthetic variables that is manageable

- In our case, there are still 27 Principal Components, but only the first few account for any significant amount of variance, while the rest can simply be discarded as noise...

# Warnings

- PCA is a linear method and thus relies on a few assumptions

--

  - multinormal distribution of the data (only if you wish to make inferences)

--

  - not too many zeros

--

  - the gradient of interest is causing the majority of the variance in the dataset

.alert[
.small[
Violation of these can cause a horseshoe shape in your biplots, where opposite ends of the horseshoe are close together but in reality represent opposite ends of a gradient]
]

---
# Warnings

- We can avoid some of these problems in PCA by choosing appropriate transformations for your community composition data or environmental data

- In some cases, such as studies that cover very large environmental gradients, it may be appropriate to use other types of unconstrained ordinations

# 4.1. Correspondance Analysis (CA)

## Euclidean vs Chi<sup>2</sup> distances

- PCA preserves **euclidean distances** between objects, and thus postulates **linear relationships** between species, and between species and environmental gradients.

- ... but in **some cases, species instead present unimodal responses** to environmental gradients

---
# Principles of CA

- In such cases, CA should be preferred compared to PCA as it preserves **Chi2 distances between sites**... and thus better represents uni modal relationships

---
# How to run a CA?

- CA is implemented in the `vegan` package using the function `cca()`:

```{r}
spe.ca <- cca(spe[-8,])
# only take columns which rowsums are > than 0.

```


- CA on fish species abundances

---
# CA: R output

- CA results are presented in the same way as PCA results and can be called using:

```{r}
summary(spe.ca)
```

- What are the significant axes?

# 4.3. Principal Coordinates Analysis

.center[![:scale 90%](images/Ord1.png)]

- In PCA, we preserve the maximum amount of variation in the data

- In PCoA, we preserve as best we can in 2D (Euclidean) distances between each object in multidimensional space

.alert[ PCoA can be especially useful when the dataset is wider than it is long (Typical problem in Genetics)]

---
# PCoA - Let's try it on Fish species!

- For computing PCoA, we can use the `cmdscale()` or the `pcoa()`functions from the **stats** and **ape** packages:

```{r, eval = F}
?cmdscale
?pcoa
```

- Run a PCoA on the Hellinger-distances of the fish dataset and extract the results
```{r}
spe.h.pcoa <- pcoa(dist(spec.hel))
summary(spe.h.pcoa)

# PCoA - Interpretation of Output

- Vectors: the eigenvectors associated to each eigenvalue contain the coordinates, in Euclidean space, of each site.

# PCoA biplot with `biplot.pcoa()`

We can display, in 2D, the distances between sites using the `biplot.pcoa()` function, as well as the species associated to each site

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
biplot.pcoa(spe.h.pcoa, spec.hel)
```


---
# PCoA and non-metric distances

- PCoA can also be used to capture information contained in non-metric distances, such as the popular Bray-Curtis distance. Let's give it a try:

```{r}
spe.bray.pcoa <- pcoa(spe.db.pa)
# spe.bray.pcoa
```

- Examine the output and notice the negative eigenvalues. This is because non-metric distances cannot be represented in Euclidean space without corrections (*see* Legendre & Legendre 2012 for more details on this):

```{r}
spe.bray.pcoa <- pcoa(spe.db.pa, correction = "cailliez")
# spe.bray.pcoa
```

---
# PCoA and non-metric distances

- Now let's visualize this using a biplot without the species (more common approach for PCoA)

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5.5, echo = -1}
par(mar=c(3,3,.5,1), cex = 1.2)
biplot.pcoa(spe.bray.pcoa)
```

# Challenge #5 ![:cube]()

Execute a PCoA on the Hellinger-transformed mite species abundance data

- What are the significant axes?
- Which groups of sites can you identify?
- Which groups of species are related to these groups of sites
- How do the PCoA results compare with the PCA results?

---
# Solution #5

- Hellinger transform the species data
```{r}
mite.spe.hel <- decostand(mite.spe, method = "hellinger")
```

- Compute PCoA

```{r}
mite.spe.h.pcoa <- pcoa(dist(mite.spe.hel))
```

---
# Solution #5

- Build a biplot to visualize the data:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
biplot.pcoa(mite.spe.h.pcoa, mite.spe.hel)
```

# Non-metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS)

- In PCA, CA and PCoA, objects are ordinated in a few number of dimensions (i.e. axis) generally > 2

- Consequently, 2D-biplots can fail to represent all the variation of the dataset

- In some cases, the objective is however to represent the data in a specified small number of dimensions

- Then, how do you plot the ordination space to represent all the variation in the data?

---
# Principles of NMDS

- NMDS
  - is the non-metric counterpart of PCoA
  - uses an iterative optimization algorithm to find the best representation of distances in reduced space
  - increasingly popular
- In NMDS, users can thus specify;
  - the number of dimensions
  - the distance measure

---
# How to run a NMDS

-  nMDS is implemented in the `vegan` package using function `metaMDS()` where
  - *distance* specifies the distance measure to use
  - *k* specifies the number of dimensions

```{r}
spe.nmds <- metaMDS(spe, distance = 'bray', k = 2)
```



---
# NMDS: goodness-of-fit

- NMDS applies an iterative procedure that tries to position the objects in the requested number of dimensions in such a way as to minimize a stress function (scaled from 0 to 1) which measure the goodness-of-fit of the distance adjustment in the reduced-space configuration.

- Consequently, the lower the stress value, the better the representation of objects in the ordination-space is.

---
# NMDS: goodness-of-fit

- The Shepard diagram and stress values can be obtained from:

```{r}
spe.nmds$stress
stressplot(spe.nmds, main = "Shepard plot")
```

---
# NMDS on fish abundances

- Run the NMDS and assess the goodness of fit

```{r, eval = F}

spe.nmds$stress
stressplot(spe.nmds, main = "Shepard plot")
```
