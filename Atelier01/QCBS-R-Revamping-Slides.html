**Common problem**

installation process of some packages

.comment[(especially a problem for permission when installing libraries)]

---
## Note for Mac user

Please install the developer package

https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#

---
## How to read the console

Text in the console typically looks like this:

.comment[You always have to push "enter" for the input to run in the console.]




```r
output
# [1] "This is the output"
```

---
## How to read the console


```r
output
# [1] "This is the output"
```

What does this bracket `[]` in the output means?

---
## How to read the console


```r
output
# [1] "This is the output"
```

The bracket help you to locate *where* you are in the output


```
#  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
# [24] 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
```

---
## Error and Warning

- .alarm[Warning message] happens with unexpected behavior in your process. You can continue to proceed your process.

- .alarm[Error message] will stop the current execution. It indicates a problem in your code

Use R to calculate the following skill testing question:

$$
2+16*24-56 / (2+1)-457
$$



```r
2+16*24-56/(2+1)-457
# [1] -89.66667
```

.comment[Note that R follows the order of the operations]

---

```r
3.1416*5^2
# [1] 78.54
```

```r
pi*5^2
# [1] 78.53982
```

class: inverse, center, middle

# Objects

---
## Objects

- One of the most useful concept in `R`!
- You can store values as named objects using the assignement operator `&lt;-`


```r
object name &lt;- assigned value
```

The value on the **right** is assigned to the name on the **left** with the assignement operator `&lt;-`

.comment[It is also possible to use the `=` sign, but it is better to **avoid it** as it is also used for other purposes.]

---
## Objects names

- Objects names can only include:

|  Type      |  Symbol |
|------------|:-------:|
| Letters    | a-z A-Z |
| Numbers    |     0-9 |
| Period     |       . |
| Underscore |       _ |

- Objects names should **always** begin with a letter.
- `R` is **case sensitive**, the names `Data1` and `data1` are not the same.
- You can **not** use special characters! (@, /, etc.)

---
## Object names: good practices

- Try having short and explicit names for your variables. Naming a variable `var`  is not very informative.
- Adding spaces after and before the `&lt;-` is recommended because it adds clarity.
- When typing the object's name, `R` return its value.


```r
mean.x &lt;- (2+6)/2

mean.x
# [1] 4
```

---
## Challenge 5 ![:cube]()

&lt;br&gt;

Create an object with a value of 1+1.718282 (Euler's number) and name it `euler.value`.

---
## Challenge 5: Solution ![:cube]()


&lt;br&gt;

Create an object with a value of 1+1.718282 (Euler's number) and name it `euler.value`.



```r
euler.value &lt;- 1+1.718282

euler.value
# [1] 2.718282
```

---
## Challenge 6 ![:cube]()

Create a second object (you decide the name) with a name that starts with a number. What happens?

---
## Challenge 6: Solution ![:cube]()


Create a second object (you decide the name) with a name that starts with a number. What happens?


Creating an object name that starts with a number returns the following error:


```r
Error: unexpected symbol in "[your object name]"
```

---
## R command line tip

- Use the tab key to autocomplete scripts
- This helps avoid spelling errors and speeds up command entering

Let's try it!

---
## R command line tip

- Enter `eu`
- Push tab
- Use the arrow keys and push enter to select the correct autocomplete

# Types of data structures in R

---
## Types of data structures in R

- Vectors
- Data frames
- Matrices, arrays and lists

---
## Vectors

- An entity consisting of a list of related values
- A single value is called an *atomic value*
- All values of a vector must have the **same mode** (or class).
      * Numeric: only numbers
      * Logical: True/False entries
      * Character: Text, or a mix of text and other modes

---
## Vectors

- Creating vectors usually require the `c` function

.comment[`c` stands for *combine* or *concatenate*.]

- The syntax is:


```r
vector &lt;- c(value1, value2, ...)
```

---
## Vectors

- Numeric vectors


```r
num.vector &lt;- c(1, 4, 3, 98, 32, -76, -4)

num.vector
# [1]   1   4   3  98  32 -76  -4
```

- Character vectors


```r
char.vector &lt;- c("blue", "red", "green")

char.vector
# [1] "blue"  "red"   "green"
```

---
## Vectors

- Logical vectors


```r
bool.vector&lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

bool.vector
# [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

You can just write T for TRUE and F for FALSE, it's exactly the same

```r
bool.vector2 &lt;- c(T, T, F)

bool.vector2
# [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

---
## Challenge 7 ![:cube]()

Create a vector containing the first 5 odd numbers, starting from 1, and name it `odd.n`

---
## Challenge 7: Solution ![:cube]()


Create a vector containing the first 5 odd numbers, starting from 1, and name it `odd.n`




```r
 odd.n &lt;- c(1,3,5,7)
```

---
## Vectors

We can use vectors for calculations


```r
  x &lt;- c(1:5)
  y &lt;- 6
```

.comment[The semicolon symbol `:` is use to combine all values between the first and the second provided numbers. `c(1:5)` returns `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`]


```r
x+y
# [1]  7  8  9 10 11

x*y
# [1]  6 12 18 24 30
```

---
## Data Frames

- Used to store data tables
- A list of vectors of the same length
- Columns = variables
- Rows = observations, sites, cases, replicates, ...
- Differents columns can have different modes

---
## Data Frames

Let's say you want to store this table in `R`:

|ID of the site|soil pH|# of species|treatment|
|---|---|---|---|
|A1.01|5.6|17|Fert|
|A1.02|7.3|23|Fert|
|B1.01|4.1|15|No Fert|
|B1.02|6.0|7|No Fert|

---
## Data Frames

One way of doing it is:
- Start by creating vectors


```r
siteID &lt;- c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02")
soil_pH &lt;- c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6.0)
num.sp &lt;- c(17, 23, 15, 7)
treatment &lt;- c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")
```

- We then combine them using the function `data.frame`


```r
my.first.df &lt;- data.frame(siteID, soil_pH, num.sp, treatment)
```

.comment[We will come back to the `data.frame` function later.]

---
## Data Frames


```r
my.first.df
#   siteID soil_pH num.sp treatment
# 1  A1.01     5.6     17      Fert
# 2  A1.02     7.3     23      Fert
# 3  B1.01     4.1     15   No_fert
# 4  B1.02     6.0      7   No_fert
```

---
## Matrices, Arrays and Lists

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/matrix.png)
]


---
## Indexing objects

Sometimes, we only want to look at or extract part of our data. This is done using **brackets:** `[]`

We indicate the **position** of the values we want to see between the brackets. It's called *indexing*.

---
## Indexing vectors


You  can use indexing to chose a particular position, let's say we want to see the second value of our `odd.n` vector



```r
odd.n[2]
# [1] 3
```

It also work with multiple position:



```r
odd.n[c(2,4)]
# [1] 3 7
```

It can be used to remove some values at particular positions



```r
odd.n[-c(1,2)]
# [1] 5 7
```

---
## Indexing vectors


If you select a position that is not in the vector it will return:


```r
odd.n[c(1,5)]
# [1]  1 NA
```

You can also use conditions to select values:



```r
odd.n[odd.n &gt; 4]
# [1] 5 7
```



```r
char.vector[char.vector == "blue"]
# [1] "blue"
```


.comment[Logical statements such as `&gt;` will be described in more details later.]


---
## Challenge 8 ![:cube]()

Using the vector `num.vector`

- Extract the 4th value
- Extract the 1st and 3rd values
- Extract all values except for the 2nd and the 4th

---
## Challenge 8: Solution ![:cube]()

- Extract the 4th value


```r
num.vector[4]
# [1] 98
```

- Extract the 1st and 3rd values


```r
num.vector[c(1,3)]
# [1] 1 3
```

- Extract all values except for the 2nd and the 4th


```r
num.vector[c(-2,-4)]
# [1]   1   3  32 -76  -4
```

---
## Challenge 9 ![:cube]()

Explore the difference between these 2 lines of code:


```r
char.vector == "blue"

char.vector[char.vector == "blue"]
```

---
## Challenge 9: Solution ![:cube]()


```r
char.vector == "blue"
# [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

In this line of code, you **test a logical statement**. For each entry in the `char.vector`,  `R` checks whether the entry is equal to `"blue"` or not.


```r
char.vector[char.vector == "blue"]
# [1] "blue"
```

In this line of code, you ask `R` to extract all values within the `col.vector` vector that are exactly equal to `"blue"`.

---
## A quick note on logical statements

`R` allows testing of logical statements, *i.e.* testing whether a statement is true or false.
You need to use logical operators for that.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
|`&lt;` and `&gt;`  |less than or greater than|`odd.n &gt; 3`                    |
|`&lt;=` and `&gt;=`|less/greater or equal to |`odd.n &gt;= 3`                   |
|`==`         |exactly equal to         |`odd.n == 3`                   |
|`!=`         |not equal to             |`odd.n != 3`                   |
|`x`&amp;#124;`y` |x OR y                   |`odd.n[odd.n &gt;= 5` &amp;#124; `odd.n &lt; 3]`|
|`x &amp; y`      |x AND y                  |`odd.n[odd.n &gt;=3 &amp; odd.n &lt; 7]` |

---
## Indexing data frames

To index a data frame you must specify two dimensions: row and column number, using the following syntax:

```r
data.frame.name[row, column]
```

---
## Indexing data frames: examples

`my.first.df[1,]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the first line


.comment[Note that an empty index select **all** the values.]

`my.first.df[,3]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the third column


`my.first.df[2,4]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the second element of the fourth column


---
## Indexing data frames: examples

`my.first.df[c(2,4),]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts lines 2 to 4

.comment[The examples given so far are also valid for indexing matrices, this is not the case for the following examples.]


`my.first.df$siteID` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the variable `siteID` from the data frame

`my.first.df$siteID[2]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the second value of the variable `siteID` from the data frame


`my.first.df[c("siteID", "soil_pH")]` ![:faic](arrow-right) Extracts the `siteID` and `soil_pH` variables from the data frame.


---
## Challenge 10 ![:cube]()

1. Extract the `num.sp` column from `my.first.df` and multiply its value by  the first four values of `num.vec`.

2. After that, write a statement that checks if the values you obtained are greater than 25.

---
## Challenge 10: Solution ![:cube]()

1. Extract the `num.sp` column from `my.first.df` and multiply its value by  the first four values of `num.vec`.


```r
my.first.df$num.sp * num.vector[c(1:4)]
# [1]  17  92  45 686
# or
my.first.df[,3] * num.vector[c(1:4)]
# [1]  17  92  45 686
```

2. After that, write a statement that checks if the values you obtained are greater than 25.



```r
(my.first.df$num.sp * num.vector[c(1:4)]) &gt; 25
# [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

# Functions

---
## Functions

.pull-left2[
A function is a tool to simplify your life.

It allows you to quickly execute operations on objects without having to write every mathematical step.

A function needs entry values called **arguments** (or parameters). It then performs hidden operations using these arguments and gives a **return value**.
]

.pull.right2[
![:scale 20%](images/function.png)
]

---
## Functions

To use (call) a function, the command must be structured properly, following the "grammar rules" of the `R` language: the syntax.


```r
function_name(argument 1, argument 2)
```

---
## Arguments

Arguments are **values** and **instructions** the function needs to run.

Objects storing these values and instructions can be used in functions:


```r
a &lt;- 3
b &lt;- 5
sum(a,b)
# [1] 8
```

---
## Challenge 11 ![:cube]()

- Create a vector `a` that contains all the numbers from 1 to 5
- Create an object `b` with a value of 2
- Add `a` and `b` together using the basic `+` operator and save the result in an object called `result_add`
- Add `a` and `b` together using the `sum` function and save the result in an object called `result_sum`
- Compare `result_add` and `result_sum`. Are they different?
- Add 5 to `result_sum` function using the `sum` function

---
## Challenge 11: Solution  ![:cube]()


```r
a &lt;- c(1:5)
b &lt;- 2

result_add &lt;- a + b

result_sum &lt;- sum(a,b)
```


```r
result_add
# [1] 3 4 5 6 7

result_sum
# [1] 17

sum(result_sum, 5)
# [1] 22
```

---
## Challenge 11: Solution  ![:cube]()

The operation `+` on the vector `a` adds 2 to each element. The result is a vector.

The function `sum` concatenates all the values provided and then sum them. It is the same as doing 1+2+3+4+5+2.

---
## Arguments

Arguments each have a **name** that can be provided during a function call.

If the name is not present, the order of the arguments does matter.

If the name is present, the order does not matter.

---
## Challenge 12 ![:cube]()

`plot` is a function that draws a graph of y as a function of x. It requires two arguments names *x* and *y*. What are the differences between the following lines?


```r
a &lt;- 1:100
b &lt;- a^2
plot(a,b)
plot(b,a)
plot(x = a, y = b)
plot(y = b, x = a)
```

---
## Challenge 12: Solution ![:cube]()

&lt;img src="QCBS-R-Revamping-Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Challenge 12: Solution ![:cube]()

.pull-left[

```r
plot(a,b)
```

&lt;img src="QCBS-R-Revamping-Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="345.6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

```r
plot(b,a)
```

&lt;img src="QCBS-R-Revamping-Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="345.6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

The shape of the plot changes, as we did not provided the arguments names, the order is important.

---
## Challenge 12: Solution ![:cube]()

.pull-left[

```r
plot(x = a, y = b)
```

&lt;img src="QCBS-R-Revamping-Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="345.6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

```r
plot(y = b, x = a)
```

&lt;img src="QCBS-R-Revamping-Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png" width="345.6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

Same as `plot(a,b)`. The argument names are provided, the order is not important.

---
## Packages

Packages are a **grouping of functions** and/or **datasets** that share a similar **theme**, e.g. statistics, spatial analysis, plotting, etc.

**Everyone** can develop packages and make them available to others.

They are usually available through the *Comprehensive R Archive Network* or CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/

Currently, more than 5877 packages are publicly availables.

---
## Packages

To install packages on your computer, use the function `install.packages`.

```r
install.packages("package name")
```

Installing a package is not enough to use it. You need to load it into your workspace before using it using the `library` function.

```r
library(package name)
```

---
## Package: an example


```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


```r
Installing package into '/home/labo/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/3.3'

## Searching for functions

WOW! `R` is so great! So many functions to do what I want!

But... how do I find them?

---
## Searching for functions

To find a function that does something specific in your installed packages, you can use `??` followed by a search term.

Let's say we want to create a *sequence* of odd numers between 0 and 10 as we did earlier. We can search in our packages all the functions with the word "sequence" in them:


```r
??sequence
```

## Getting help with functions

OK! SO let's use the `seq` function!!

But wait... how does it work? What arguments does it need?

To find information about a function in particular, use `?`


```r
  ?seq
```

## Challenge 13: Solutions ![:cube]()

1. Create a sequence of even numbers from 0 to 10 using the `seq` function.

.pull-left[

```r
seq(from=0, to=10, by=2)
# [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
seq(0,10,2)
# [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10
```
]


2. Create a unsorted vector of your favourite numbers, then sort your vector in reverse order.


```r
numbers &lt;- c(2,4,22,6,26)
sort(numbers, decreasing = T)
# [1] 26 22  6  4  2
```

## Other ways to get help

Usually, your best source of information will be your favorite search engine!

Here are some tips on how to use them efficiently:
- Search in English
- Use the keyword "R" at the beginning of your search
- Define precisely what you are looking for
- Learn to read discussion forums. Chances are other people already had your problem and asked about it.
- Don't hesitate to search again using different keywords!
