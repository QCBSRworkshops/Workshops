## Limitations of linear (mixed) models

Load dataset and fit a linear model (`lm()`):

```{r,echo=FALSE}
  mites <- read.csv('data/mites.csv')
```

```{r,eval=F}
  # make sure you're in the right working directory
  mites <- read.csv('mites.csv')
  head(mites)
  str(mites)
```

The dataset that you just loaded is a subset of the 'Oribatid mite dataset'

.small[
> 70 moss and mite samples

> 5 environmental measurements and abundance of the mite *Galumna sp.*
]

**Goal**: Model the abundance (`abund`), occurrence (`pa`), and proportion (`prop`) of Galumna as a function of the 5 environmental variables.

---
## Exploring relationships

Can we see any relationship(s) between Galumna and the 5 environmental variables?

## Exploring relationships

A negative relationship between `Galumna` and water `content`?

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=4.5,echo=-1}
  par(mypar)
  par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex = 1.4)
  plot(Galumna ~ WatrCont, data = mites, xlab = 'Water content', ylab='Abundance')
  boxplot(WatrCont ~ pa, data = mites, xlab='Presence/Absence', ylab = 'Water content')
  plot(prop ~ WatrCont, data = mites, xlab = 'Water content', ylab='Proportion')
```

---
## Testing linearity

Fit linear models to test whether `abund`, `pa`, and/or `prop` varies as a function of water content.

```{r, eval = -c(2, 4, 6)}
  lm.abund <- lm(Galumna ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
  summary(lm.abund)
  lm.pa <- lm(pa ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
  summary(lm.pa)
  lm.prop <- lm(prop ~ WatrCont, data = mites)
  summary(lm.prop)
```

## Model assumptions

Common in Ecology that assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality are not met.
  - Main reason why we need GLMs!

.comment[Let's revisit the assumptions of lm...]

---
## Model assumptions

Equation of lm:

$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon$

where:

$y_i$ = predicted value of response variable

$\beta_0$ = intercept

$\beta_1$ = slope

$x_i$ = explanatory variable

$\varepsilon_i$ = model residuals drawn from a normal distribution with a varying mean but a constant variance**

.comment[.alert[**Key point!] Residuals (the distance between each observation and the regression line) can be predicted by drawing random values from a normal distribution.]

---
## Normally distributed residuals

Recall: Normal distributions have two parameters, $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma$ (variance):

<br>
.pull-left[
Varing $\mu$, $\sigma = 5$

```{r,echo=F}
x = seq(1, 50, 0.1)
par(mypar);par(cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dnorm(x, mean = 20, sd = 5), type = 'l', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability')
points(x, dnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 5), type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = 2)
points(x, dnorm(x, mean = 30, sd = 5), type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = 4)
legend('topleft', legend = c('20', '25', '30'), lty = 1, col = 1:3, bty = 'n', lwd = 2, cex = 1.1)
```
]
.pull-right[
$\mu = 25$, varing $\sigma$

```{r,echo=F}
x = seq(1, 50, 0.1)
par(mypar);par(cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 5), type = 'l', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability')
points(x, dnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 7.5), type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = 2)
points(x, dnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 10), type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = 4)
legend('topleft', legend = c('5', '7.5', '10'), lty = 1, col = 1:3, bty = 'n', lwd = 2, cex = 1.1)
```
]

---
## Normally distributed residuals

Another way to write the lm equation is:

$y_i \sim N(\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i, \sigma^2)$

<br>
Which literally means that $y_i$ is drawn from a normal distribution with parameters $\mu$ (which depends on $x_i$) and $\sigma$ (which has the same value for all $Y$s)

<br>
.comment[Lets predict Galumna abund as a function of water content using the `lm` we fitted earlier...]

---
## Model prediction

We need regression coefficients ( $\beta$) and $\sigma$:

```{r}
coef(lm.abund)
summary(lm.abund)$sigma
```

What are the parameters of the normal distribution used to model $y$ when water content = 300?

$y_i \sim N(\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i, \sigma^2)$

--

$\mu = 3.44 + (-0.006 x 300) = 1.63$

$\sigma = 1.51$

---
## Model prediction

- At $x = 300$, residuals should follow a normal distribution with $\mu = 1.63$ and $\sigma^2 = 1.51$.

- At $x = 400$, we get $\mu = 1.02$ and $\sigma^2 = 1.51$, etc.

<br>
Graphically, this is our model:

**Problems**:
- $\sigma^2$ is not homogeneous, yet `lm()` forces a constant $\sigma^2$
- Predicted values should be integers

## Biological data & distributions

Statisticians have described a multitude of distributions that correspond to different types of data

A distribution provides the probability of observing each possible outcome of an experiment or survey (e.g. $abund = 8$ Galumna)

Distributions can be **discrete** (only includes integers
or **continuous** (includes fractions)

All distributions have **parameters** that dictate the shape of the distribution (e.g. $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for the normal)

---
## Biological data & distributions

Galumna abund follows a discrete distribution (can only take integer values).

A useful distribution to model abundance data is the “Poisson” distribution:

  - a discrete distribution with a single parameter, $\lambda$ (lambda), which defines both the mean and the variance of the distribution:

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=15}
x = seq(1, 50, 1)
par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 1), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 1')
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 10), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 10')
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 30), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 30')
```

---
## Biological data & distributions

Galumna seems to follow a Poisson distribution with a low value of $\lambda$:

.pull-left[
```{r}
  hist(mites$Galumna)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
  mean(mites$Galumna)
```
]

---
## Biological data & distributions

Presence-absence takes yet another form:

- only `0`s and `1`s
- Poisson distribution would not be appropriate to model this variable

```{r,fig.height=5,echo=-1}
  par(mypar);par(cex=1.4)
  hist(mites$pa)
```

---
## Biological data & distributions

**“Bernoulli” distribution**:

- Only two possible outcomes in its range: success (`1`) or failure (`0`)
- One parameter, $p$, the probability of success

<br>
```{r,echo=-F,fig.width=12,fig.height=4}
  par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex=1.4)
  barplot(setNames(c(.9, .1), c('absent (0)', 'present (1)')), ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = 'pa', ylab = 'probability', main = 'p = 0.1')
  barplot(setNames(c(.5, .5), c('absent (0)', 'present (1)')), ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = 'pa', ylab = 'probability', main = 'p = 0.5')
  barplot(setNames(c(.1, .9), c('absent (0)', 'present (1)')), ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = 'pa', ylab = 'probability', main = 'p = 0.9')
```

We can use the Bernouilli distribution to calculate the probability Galumna present (`1`) vs. absent (`0`)

---
## Biological data & distributions

**Binomial distribution**: When there are multiple trials (each with a success/failure), the Bernoulli distribution expands into the binomial
- Additional parameter, n, for number of trials
- Predicts the probability of observing a given proportion of successes, p, out of a known total number of trials, $n$

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=15}
x = seq(1, 50, 1)
par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 3), cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = 0.1), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'p = 0.1 n = 50')
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = 0.5), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'p = 0.5 n = 50')
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = 0.9), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'p = 0.9 n = 50')
```

---
## Biological data & distributions

**Binomial distribution**: used to model data where the number of successes are integers and where the number of trials, n, is known.

**Main difference with Poisson distribution**: the binomial has an upper limit to its range, corresponding to `n`. Consequently, it is right-skewed at low p values but left-skewed at high `p` values

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
x = seq(1, 50, 1)
par(mypar);par(mfrow = c(1, 2), cex = 1.4)
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = 0.9), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'p = 0.9 n = 50')
plot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 30), type = 'h', lwd = 3, xlab = '# galumna', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'lambda = 30')
```

## Biological data & distributions

Getting back to our problem... can switch the distribution of error terms (εi) from normal to Poisson:

$$y_i \sim Poisson(\lambda = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)$$

Problems solved!

1. $\lambda$ varies with $x$ (water content) which means residual variance will also vary with $x$, which means that we just relaxed the homogeneity of variance assumption!

2. Predicted values will now be integers instead of fractions

3. The model will never predict negative values (Poisson is strictly positive)

---
## Biological data & distributions

This is **almost** a Poisson GLM, which looks like this:

.center[![:scale 90%](images/poisPred.png)]

Probabilities (in orange) are now integers, and both the variance and the mean of the distribution decline as $\lambda$ decreases with increasing water content.
